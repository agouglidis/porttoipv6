- 09 May 2017: Release of PortToIPv6 0.0.5 Alpha 

	Move to GitHub. Just a few minor changes in the code. 

- 20 March 2007: Release of PortToIPv6 0.0.4 Alpha 

	General notes: 
		+ (Debian) currently using g++ (GCC) 4.1.2 and flex++ 2.5.33
		+ (Windows) currently using cygwin g++ (GCC) 3.4.4, flex++ version 2.5.4 and cygwin1.dll version 1.5.24
		+ A better class hierarchy of mappers
		+ General improvements of base porting mapper

	New Features:
		+ Installer and code identifies CYGWIN enviroment and compile/install automatically
		+ Addition of Winsock porting mapper

- 02 February 2007: Release of PortToIPv6 0.0.3 Alpha for Windows

- 28 July 2006: Release of PortToIPv6 0.0.3 Alpha

	New Features:
		+ PfMapper supports a more advanced IPv4 address conversion function. It provides a simple
			interactive interface to the user and automatically constructs global, link-local,
			site local, Teredo etc style IPv6 addresses.
		+ Support of illimitably API identifiers by ipv4scanner and API Mappers by ipv6cg

	Fixes:
		+ Installer still prints out that everything was compiled correctly, even if an error occurs: FIXED
		+ Line numbering is broken. Yeah, yeah I know, my mistake people. Switched back to lineno() :) : FIXED
		+ Major code refining. A better API to add your own API identifiers and API Mappers


- 25 June 2006: Release of PortToIPv6 0.0.2 Beta
	General notes: 
		+ currently using gcc version 4.1.0 instead of gcc version 4.0.2
		+ currently using flex++ 2.5.31 instead of flex++ 2.5.4
		+ use of Doxygen for the source code documentation 
		+ new bash shell install script, with DEBUG ON|OFF functionality

	common.{h, cc}:
		+ atoi (c style) function has been substitued with ToString (c++ style)

	mos:
		+ memory leak in main: FIXED
		+ #include_xml does not include CONDITION tags: FIXED

	IPv4Scanner:
		+ sustitution of yylineno() with a manual implementation for performance issues (PF_LINE_NUM)

	ipv6cg:
		+ memory leak in FindString function: FIXED

	TODO:
		...

- 28 April 2006: Release of PortToIPv6 0.0.2 Alpha

	- mos 0.0.2
		- support of #include_verbatim, to include verbatim code 
		- support of #include_xml, to include specific XML data structures and generate automatically source code
		- Use of tinyXml

	- ipv4scanner 0.0.2
		- code refining due to mos changes

	- ipv6cg 0.0.2 (first release)
		- Implementation of a base class PfBaseClass, a.k.a. core engine for the code generator
		- Implementation of MapperBsd, based on the RFC-2133 guidelines for Basic Socket Interface Extensions for IPv6
		- Use of tinyXml

	TODO:
	- mos: ?
	- ipv4scanner: support of more than 2 APIs
	- ipv6cg: 
		- This tool is still immature and needs a lot of refining. It is out there mostly for testing. 
		- Try to include RFC-2292 guidelines about Advanced Sockets API for IPv6
		- Improve class API
		- support more mappers
		- 
	- Documentation, porting tutorials.

	Still a lot to do :)
